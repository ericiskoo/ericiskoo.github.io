<p>SpeakEasy is a prototype system that helps users practice and improve their public speaking. This was a semester-long project that we submitted to the CHI Student Design Competition on "Quantified Self".</p>
<p>We interviewed students, professors, and also participated in several Toastmasters International meetings. We consolidated our findings using an affinity diagram and discovered many common traits that people attributed to good public speaking including: number of filler words, volume, words per minute, intonation, eye contact, body language, and hand gestures. We also learned that most individuals who practiced for a speech did so alone and thus never received any feedback or constructive criticism.</p>
<p>Our proposed system would allow users to practice their talks in front of a computer, which would automatically track various auditory and physical metrics. This would not only provide detailed, instantaneous feedback to users but would also allow individuals to track their improvement over time with specific, quantifiable metrics.</p>

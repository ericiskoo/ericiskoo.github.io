<h2>UM Coursera Data Analysis</h2>
<p>I worked for a year as a research assistant at the University of Michigan's USE Lab analyzing Coursera MOOC data. I took the original Machine Learning offered course by Professor Andrew Ng back in 2011 and have been interested in MOOCs and the e-learning field ever since. My work analyzing UM's Coursera courses involved lots of data processing and merging datasets from different sources including SQL data exports from Coursera, survey data from Qualtrics, and geolocation data based on ip address. Some of the tools that I used include Python, Pandas, R, ggplot2, and MySQL.</p>
<p>The results of my initial data analyses were presented at a Student Learning and Analytics at Michigan (SLAM) seminar. I worked closely with Christopher Brooks and working on longitudinal analyses of courses offered multiple times. Many of the Python scripts that we have written are available publicly at the USE Lab Bitbucket repository.</p>
